# SafeTransact-CreditCardFraudDetection

## ABSTRACT
Credit card fraud is a significant issue, causing billions of dollars in losses annually. Machine learning offers an efficient way to detect fraudulent transactions by recognizing patterns indicative of fraud. This project develops and evaluates multiple machine learning models to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. By comparing model performances, the most effective algorithm is selected for accurate fraud detection.

## Overview
With the rise in credit card usage, ensuring transaction security has become crucial. Reports of credit card fraud have surged significantly, making fraud detection a priority. This project applies various machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent activities. By analyzing large datasets and applying algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree (DT), the goal is to identify the most accurate fraud detection model.
